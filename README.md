# HW18-Progressive-Budget

## Description
This program is used to keep track of transactions. Transactions can be added or subtracting by naming the transaction and the transaction then pressing either the add funds or subtract funds. The site uses indexdb along with service workers to allow the site to be able to store data offline and add the transactions to the database once the site loads online.

## Contributers
